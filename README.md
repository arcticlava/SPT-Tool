# SPT Tool for Healthcare Portals
User Authentication Combining Decentralized Identity with Delegated Medical Permissions 

This project provides a mechanism to delegate Medical Permissions to HIPAA-compliant proxies. This applies to Healthcare Portals that have already enabled authentication via Self-Sovereign Identities (SSI). Syscoin Platform Tokens (SPTs) can be configured to bind an existing DID document and can be validated (signed) by the DID Issuer. 

It is recommended to use the syscoin/sycsoin-js library.
