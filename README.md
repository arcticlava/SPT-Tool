# SPT Tool for Healthcare Portals
Universal Health Record Portal with Delegated Medical Permissions 

<<<<<<< HEAD
This project provides a mechanism to delegate Medical Permissions to HIPAA-compliant proxies. This applies to Healthcare Portals that have already enabled authentication via Self-Sovereign Identities (SSI). Syscoin Platform Tokens (SPTs) can be configured to bind an existing DID document and can be validated (signed) by the DID Issuer.
